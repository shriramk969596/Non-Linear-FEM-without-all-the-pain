# Non-Linear-FEM-without-all-the-pain

This is a project I plan to create for the near future with a collection all relevant material including sample codes to get anyone with basic FEM knowledge started with non linear FEM.

Topics:
- Continuum Mechanics(With introduction to tensor calculus)
- The weak form
- Linearization of the weak form (basics on Gateaux/Directional derivative)
- The concept of iso parametric mapping.
- Discretization of the weak form (in the linearized form)
- Going from the discretized(linearized) weak form to a system of linear equations(or a system of linear   ODE's in the case of transient problems) using the Newton Raphson method.(concept of pseudo time         steps or load stepping) 
- Time integration for transient problems
- Fast iterative solvers to solve system of linear equations.(Generalized minimal residual                 method(GMRES), Conjugate gradient(CG)).
Tentative Topics:
- Contact problems
- modelling Hyperelasticity, Inelasticity(Plasticity, Viscous behaviour)
- UMAT/VUMAT and DLOAD for ABAQUS
